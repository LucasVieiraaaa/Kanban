# Kanban

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.2.

## Description

This Angular project is a dynamic Kanban board application designed to streamline task management. The application features a three-column layout for organizing tasks by their status: 'To Do,' 'Doing,' and 'Done.' Each column serves as a stage in the workflow, allowing users to visualize and track task progress from start to completion.

The project includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for task cards. Users can create new task cards with customizable details, edit existing ones to update progress or adjust task descriptions, and delete cards when tasks are complete or no longer relevant. Each card represents an individual task, with fields for a title, description, and any relevant tags or priority indicators.
